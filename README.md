## What's the problem?

The world has also seen an upsurge in creative space as the world continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic turmoil. The lockdowns in all part of the world and the rise of remote work has unleashed a new fervor of creativity, with many tapping into themselves to defeat boredom as the world ground to a halt. Studies have shown that interest and creativity, especially in artistic media like painting, photography, poetry, and mixed media increased significantly during the lockdown and have been on the upswing since.

This creativity induced by lockdowns has had a profound effect on people’s daily habits, relationships, and professional careers, and thus many have changed and adapted their lives by connecting and collaborating with others in their immediate locality and all around the globe. These connections and collaborations are however not being exploited to their full potential as there is a scarcity of dedicated platforms for the discovery of similarly talented individuals.

We understand how difficult it can seem to have voices heard especially in a world that favors those that are privileged to have connections or those who have already "made it" without looking at talents or prospects, and we want to bridge this gap.
